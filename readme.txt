Improving the current GD implementation

== Description ==

This plugin tries to fix things when you use GD for resizing. Currently when an image got resized it will lose all EXIF/IPTC data what can be a pain for some people. When using this plugin you will retain some of the data by storing it as IPTC data.


== Installation ==

1. Upload the folder improved-td-image-editor to the /wp-content/plugins/ directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Done!

== Changelog ==

= 1.2 ( 2014-09-04 ) =
* Fixed issue on activation
* Fix check if editor was already loaded

= 1.0 ( 2013-07-10 ) =
* First version that add IPTC support
